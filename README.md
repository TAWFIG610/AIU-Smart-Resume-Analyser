## üìö Background & Objectives

### 1.1 Background of the Study
The AIU Smart Resume Analyzer is an innovative project developed to modernize the recruitment process at Albukhary International University (AIU) through the application of advanced NLP techniques. The system intelligently analyzes resumes and identifies skill gaps (Gupta & Lee, 2025), helping HR professionals make strategic hiring decisions by reducing the time and effort required to link candidate qualifications with job requirements (Albukhary International University, 2025). By automating the assessment process, the platform ensures vital information is not missed and aligns candidate profiles with job-specific needs (Zhang & Kumar, 2025). The project reflects AIU‚Äôs commitment to innovation, operational excellence, and the promotion of sustainable and talent-driven practices in higher education (Patel & Brown, 2025).

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Traditional recruitment methods are often slow, error-prone, and lack the precision required for evaluating resumes in depth. Critical data like skills and relevant experience can be missed, and applicants rarely receive feedback on how to improve their profiles (Patel & Brown, 2025). These inefficiencies are particularly problematic in dynamic academic environments like AIU. The AIU Smart Resume Analyzer aims to resolve these challenges by using NLP to extract key information from resumes and match candidate profiles to job descriptions, reducing HR workload and improving accuracy (Zhang & Kumar, 2025).

### 1.3 Research Questions
1. How effective is the proposed resume analyzer in reducing hiring bias, as measured through HR feedback and system audits at AIU?  
2. What are the limitations and challenges of the existing system framework in accurately analyzing resumes for skills, qualifications, and relevant experiences?  
3. How can a secure, interactive dashboard be built to enable HR to visualize and manage resume analytics efficiently?

### 1.4 Research Objectives
- To study existing resume analysis systems that identify skills, qualifications, and experience.  
- To design and develop an NLP-powered resume analyzer for AIU HR.  
- To build a secure, interactive dashboard for resume analytics to support strategic hiring.

### 1.5 Scope of the Study
This project automates resume screening and acts as a centralized platform for evaluation based on specific criteria. It reduces human error, improves processing speed, and supports career development by detecting skill gaps. The system also incorporates a secure data storage solution that protects user privacy while allowing controlled access and updates.

### 1.6 Significance and Motivation of the Study
The Smart Resume Analyzer transforms recruitment at AIU by automating resume analysis and aligning candidate data with job roles, increasing HR efficiency and strategic capability (Naik & Singh, 2021). It supports the university‚Äôs digital transformation and enhances its standing as a progressive, tech-enabled institution fostering global best practices (Doe & Smith, 2025).
